# NYC Citi Bike Analysis using Tableau


## **Overview of the NYC Citi Bike Analysis**: for this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we created a set of visualizations to:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### This assignment consisted of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present our results. Hence, we are submitting the following:

#### Deliverable 1: Changed Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
#### Deliverable 2: Created Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
#### Deliverable 3: Created a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## **Results**:

###. Viz 1 - Checkout Times for Users
